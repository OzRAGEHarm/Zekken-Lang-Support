# Zekken Language Support for VS Code Extension

This is an open source Visual Studio Code syntax highlighting extension (that took WAY too long for me to actually get working) for my programming language [Zekken](https://github.com/OzRAGEHarm/Zekken), which is also open source!

## Downloading the extension
You can find and install the extension by going [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OzRAGEHarm.zekken-language-support) or by searching `Zekken Language Support` on the "Extensions" tab in Visual Studio Code.
